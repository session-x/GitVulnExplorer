# GitVulnExplorer

**GitVulnExplorer** is a web-based tool designed for ethical hackers, bug bounty hunters, and security researchers to explore potential vulnerabilities in publicly available GitHub repositories. By simply entering a GitHub URL or targeting specific repositories or organizations (e.g., "paypal" or `org:paypal`), users can easily discover exposed files, misconfigurations, and other security risks. It helps you explore GitHub repositories for sensitive information, such as `.txt` files, through a simple and intuitive interface.
